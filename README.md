# The Rust Arena

A list of all things Rust with my personal reviews.

## How is this different from [Awesome Rust][awesome-rust]?

[awesome-rust]: https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust

This list aims to be more personal, more curated, and more insightful than
Awesome Rust. Awesome Rust is, well, awesome, but it feels like a list of
_everything_ with no insights on what the things being listed are actually like.
This list is my personal curation of Rust things with my reviews as well as
suggestions and reviews from the community. My goals are:

- to keep a list of the _good_ stuff;
- to give a brief note on what's good and what's bad about those stuff;
- to welcome opinions from the community.

## 📚 `mod books`

* [The Rust Programming Language][the book] :star::star::star::star:: _The_
  introductory text to Rust programming for people of all programming
  experiences. The book will walk you from the very basics, to Rust's distinct
  features like ownership, borrowing, traits, generics, and lifetimes, to Cargo,
  pattern matching, and advanced Rust.<br/><br/>
  _"The book" touches on the basics of every topic inside it, just enough to get
  you started. A great explainer of everything it decides to talk about, the book
  can however gets a little wordy at times for experienced programmers. Overall,
  a strong recommendation for **anyone** who wants to get started with Rust._

## ⚙️ `mod libraries`

## 💾 `mod binaries`

## 📹 `mod youtubers`

## 🎤 `mod podcasts`

## 🕶️ `mod misc`

* [The Rustlings][rustlings] :star::star::star::star::star:: A series of small
  Rust exercises in the form of unit tests to help you learn Rust. A great
  companion to "the book", as the two resources have a similar curriculum.<br/>
  <br/>
  _Super enjoyable. Highly recommended for everyone who's learning the basics of
  Rust regardless of how they're learning it._
