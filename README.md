# The Rust Arena

A list of all things Rust with my personal reviews.

## How is this different from [Awesome Rust][awesome-rust]?

[awesome-rust]: https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust

This list aims to be more personal, more curated, and more insightful than
Awesome Rust. Awesome Rust is, well, awesome, but it feels like a list of
_everything_ with no insights on what the things being listed are actually like.
This list is my personal curation of Rust things with my reviews as well as
suggestions and reviews from the community. My goals are:

- to keep a list of the _good_ stuff;
- to give a brief note on what's good and what's bad about those stuff;
- to welcome opinions from the community.
